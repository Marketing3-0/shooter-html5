# shooter.io (HTML5)

HTML5 client for the [shooter-server][4] that powers [shooter.io][3].

This is a work in progress :-).

## How to run the site

It's easy. Open your favorite terminal and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/xiam/shooter-html5.git
cd ./shooter-html5/src
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

The last command will run a HTTP server on `localhost`, fire up Chrome and type
`http://localhost:8000` to see the game.

Running a local `shooter-server` is not required, as this client will connect
to the main [shooter.io][3] game server by itself.
