# shooter.io (HTML5)

Client for the [shooter-server][4] that powers [shooter.io][3].

This is a work in progress :-).

## How to run the site

```
git clone https://github.com/xiam/shooter-html5.git
cd ./shooter-html5/src
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Running a local server is not necessary, it will connect to the main
[shooter.io][3] site.
